#  For 4707/8/9 - Required to set the DDR PHY clock correctly *before*

#  while XIP processing is still active. This is a limitation of the

# et0mcdport is which MDC/MDIO port is used to connect to the internal or external Ethernet switch or PHY.
# Nearly all wireless chips have only one external Ethernet MAC so this parameter should be set to "0".
et0mdcport=0
# et0phyaddr is the MDIO address of the internal or external Ethernet switch or PHY.
# For all Broadcom Ethernet switches, internal to the wireless chip or external to it, will have an address of "30".
# External PHY chips will have strapping options to set their address and that address can range from 0-31.
et0phyaddr=30

# Set the MAC address of the Ethernet ports
# From 9/2009 onward MAC addresses have changed from an 8/16 split between macmid and the serial number, to a 12/12 split,
# so the new macmid will be based on MAC addresses with the following format:
#   47   40 39   32 31   24 23   16 15    8 7     0
#  |  00   |  90   |  4C   |  XX   |  XY   |  YY   |
# where the low 24 bits are evenly split into 4096 interface/ boardtypes and 4096 serial numbers. The low nibble of
# XXX cannot be 0, since that corresponds to an old style MAC address, and macmid will correspond to bits 23:12, so
# its easy to differentiate them from the old ones.
#
# The new "macmid" values will start at 1 and go up to 0xFFF, skipping those that have the low nibble as 0 and the
# ones with the patterns 0x04Ex and 0x04Fx (These restrictions are enforced in the code). To form the mac address,
# the whole OUI (00:90:4C) will be prepended to those values and 12 bits of serial number will be appended.
#
# A new-style macmid:
#   BCM947186nrh  0x008
#
# For router boards, nvserial now defines a new variable: "maclo12"
# so nvram text files for new boards will have to define the MAC address like this (for a macmid 0x008):
#   et0macaddr=00:90:4C:00:8${maclo12}
# instead of the previous way:

# Ethernet switch VLAN configuration.
# These parameters configure VLANs (Virtual LANs) for the internal or external Ethernet switch. This is done mainly
# to separate the WAN port of a router from the LAN ports.
# All Broadcom switches that have MAC ports with built-in PHYs will number the ports with PHYs starting at 0 and
# incrementing upwards. For the MAC ports without PHYs, the numbering of that port(s) can vary. The table below shows
# the numbering of the MAC only ports in various Broadcom chips.
#
#  Broadcom Chip   MAC only ports
#  --------------  --------------
#  BCM5356               5
#  BCM5357/5358U         5
#  BCM5358               5
#  BCM47186              8
#  BCM53115             5,8
#  BCM53125             5,8
#  BCM4707/8/9/81      5,7,8
#
# One of these ports will connect the Ethernet switch to the CPU of the wireless chip. For chips will built-in Ethernet
# switches and PHYs, this port will be internal to the chip. This port number must be included in every VLAN definition
# for the wireless chip to be able to route/bridge network traffic between the Ethernet ports, the wireless network(s),
# and any other network device in the design (such as DSL, PLC, cellular data, etc…).
#
# A special symbol - an "*" - must be added to the end one, and only one, vlanXports parameter. This indicates which
# VLAN is to be used by the bootloader for Ethernet network connections. Typically this the VLAN for the LAN ports.
#
# There are two other special tags that can be added after the MAC port number that connects to the CPU:
#   "u" - configures the switch to not add VLAN tags for packets to/from the CPU and the other port(s) in the VLAN port list.
#   "t" - configures the switch to add VLAN tags for packets to/from the CPU and the other port(s) in the VLAN port list.
#         This is the normal behavior so the "t" is usually omitted.
#
# Also see the note under "wandevs" parameter when the WAN VLAN is tagged.
# Typically vlan1 is the LAN, and vlan2 is the WAN)
# NOTE: Bit 8 of boardflags must be set to "1" for these parameters to work.
#
# WAN is on port 0, LAN is on ports 1-4. Port 5 is the MAC interface to the external switch or switch core.
#
# vlan1 is the LAN.
vlan1ports=0 1 2 5*
vlan1hwname=et0

# vlan2 is the WAN.
vlan2ports=3 5u
vlan2hwname=et0

# The landevs parameter is used to connect (or "bridge") a number of different network interfaces together to form the
# LAN of the wireless router/AP design. Typically the two main network interfaces that are part of the LAN are the
# Ethernet port(s), and the wireless network interface(s).
#   Example: landevs=vlan1 wl0
# This would bridge the Ethernet VLAN named "vlan1" with the one wireless interface named "wl0", together to form the LAN.
#
#   Example: landevs=vlan1 wl0 wl1
# This would bridge the Ethernet VLAN named "vlan1" with the two wireless interfaces named "wl0" and "wl1", together to
# form the LAN. Two wireless interfaces are used for simultaneous dual-band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) router/AP designs.
#
# If VLAN names are not used, then device names such as "et0" must be used for Ethernet instead.
#
landevs=vlan1 wl0 wl1

# The wandevs parameter is used to tell the software which network interface to use as the WAN. Typically the WAN is an Ethernet port.
# If Ethernet WAN packets are VLAN tagged, then wandevs should be set to "vlanX", where "X" is the VLAN number that
# corresponds to the WAN VLAN number as set by a "vlanXports" and "vlanXhwname" parameter pair.
# For when Ethernet WAN packets are not VLAN tagged, then wandevs should be set to "etX", where "X" is the number of the
# Ethernet interface that contains the WAN port, typically "0". So typically wandevs is set to "et0".
#
# NOTE: If the board does not have a WAN port then must use "wandevs=", without any device name assignment. This is
# critical for the proper functioning of the network software when there is no WAN port.
#
# The WAN port is almost always on an Ethernet port so use the normal config. If the WAN port is not an Ethernet port,
# then this parameter must be changed accordingly.
#
# WAN port is on eth0.
wandevs=et0

# Set the factory default IP address and subnet mask for the router.
lan_ipaddr=192.168.1.1
lan_netmask=255.255.255.0


# WPS Configuration Parameters

# If the board supports WPS, then these parameters tell the software
# which GPIO is used for the WPS pushbutton and which is used for the WPS LED indicator.
#gpio2=wps_led
#gpio3=wps_button


# Other Parameters

# Enable a short delay on boot so the CFE delays before loading and executing Linux. Durring this time the CFE listens
# for a TFTP transfer to come in from an external source via the Ethernet LAN. The purpose of this process is to
# enable easy firmware upgrades and support manufacturing testing.
boot_wait=on

# If boot_wait is on, then "wait_time" sets the wait time from 1 to 99 seconds. Three seconds is long enough time to
# allow a TFTP transfer to start, while not slowing down the overall boot time.
wait_time=1

# Watchdog timer in ms.
# For all CPU chips other than the 4707/8/9/81, the valid range is 3000ms to 5500ms.
# For the 4707/8/9/81 the valid range is 1000ms to 2100ms.
# A setting of 0 will disable the watchdog.
watchdog=2100

# For a PCIe interface to the wireless chip, these parameters must have a special prefix. There are two formats for this prefix:
# The old format is:
#   pci/<bus_#>/<slot_#>/<param>
#
#   where: <bus_#> is the PCIe bus number. It is the RC (root complex) number + 1.
#             (Ex: bus_# = 1 for the first RC/PCIe port. bus_# = 2 for the second RC/PCIe port.)
#          <slot_#> slot number is always "1" for PCIe.
#          <param> is the parameter assignment. i.e. "boardflags=0x0000A248"
#
# The new format is:
#   pcie/<domain_#>/<bus_#>/<param>     NOTE the first part of the parameter is "pcie", not "pci".
#
#   where: <domain_#> is the PCIe RC (root complex) number + 1. I.E. for PCIe port "PCI0" the domain number is "1".
#          <bus_#> is the PCIe bus number
#             This is alwasy "1" unless the wireless chip is behind a PCIe switch chip, then it will be a higher number.
#             What that number is depends upon the switch chip and what downstream port of the swtich chip the wireless
#             chip is connected to.
#               For a PXL PEX8603 PCIe switch chip, it's downstream port #1 is bus_# 3, and port #2 is bus_# 4.
#          <param> is the parameter assignment. i.e. "boardflags=0x0000A248"

# The 43602 2.4GHz high power RF section, like on the 43602mch2 P102, using sromrev=11, is connected to port #2 of the PLX PEX8603
# PCIe switch, which is connected to port #0 of the 4709. So the domain_#=1, bus_#=4 in the new format. (bus_#=4, slot_#=1 in the old format)

# Due to the increasing number of NVRAM parameters being added with new wireless chips, sometimes the NVRAM will grow too
# large and not fit in the 4K allocated to it in the CFE image. In order to compress the NVRAM somewhat, the
# "devpathX=<prefix>" notation can be used.
#
# The "devpathX" parameters set an abbreviated notation to replace a prefix. The notation for the abbreviated prefix
# is "X:", where X is the same number as used in the "devpathX=<prefix>" definition.
#
# For example, if "devpath1=pcie/1/1/" is set, then instead of using the full "pcie/1/1/" prefix, the abbreviation "1:" is used as the prefix.
#
# NOTE: With the use of compressed eNVRAM there is no longer a need to use "devpathX" parameters, and the full prefixes should be used.
#
#devpath0=pcie/1/4/
